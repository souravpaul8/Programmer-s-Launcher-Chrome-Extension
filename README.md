# Programmer-s-Launcher-Chrome-Extension
Quick Links to most frequently used Websites by programmers.

For now, until I publish it to the Chrome webstore, you can use it by following the below steps:
1. Download the repository as ZIP.
2. Extract It.
3. Open Chrome or Edge Chromium, and go to extension.
4. Switch developer mode on if it's off.
5. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the Extracted folder.
This will add the extension to your browser. Then Enjoy using it !

Download from the Firefox Add-ons at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sourav-paul/
Soon the stable build will be uploaded to the Chrome Webstore.
